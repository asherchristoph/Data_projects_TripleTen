Good Seed has requested help in creating a model to verify ages of customers buying alcohol. They have provided data with image-label pairs to train the model. We will be perfroming EDA to identify age distributions and outliers, then training the model using the ResNet50 framework.
This project utilized the Tensorflow library to create a model capable of verifying the age of a customer purchasing alcohol.  Given the provided image-label pairs, and relevant age data, EDA revealed the age distribution of provided image-label pairs peaked 29 within the total range of 4-100, with the relevant distribution being 20-41.  Focusing on that group allowed for intentional training of the model, keeping processing time to a minimum and accuracy high.
